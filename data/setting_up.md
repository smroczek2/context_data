# Seasonal Fees: Templates and Scheduling
A Seasonal Fee is a fee added to an account or individual only once per season. Seasonal Fees are commonly used to assess one-time registration fees, application fees, etc. They are triggered automatically by a reservation or added manually.


 


## Seasonal Fee Template


A Seasonal Fee Template controls the settings for a give seasonal fee, including the dollar amount and how it assigns on the account. Once a template is created, it still must be connected to a session in order for it to work.    


**To create a Seasonal Fee Template:** 


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand **Fees / Payments.**
	2. Select **Seasonal Fee Templates.**


 


## Seasonal Fee Template Settings


* **Fee Name:** This identifies the fee on the admin side and will display to the client as well.
* **Fee Type:** A seasonal fee can be triggered to add once Per Account per season when one or more reservations are made or it can be triggered to add once Per Person per season when one or more reservations are made. Indicate which behavior you wish to occur using the Fee Type dropdown menu.
* **Amount:** In the provided field, indicate the Amount the fee will charge when triggered.
* **Allocation Account:** Monies collected for a Seasonal Fee can be assigned to a specific Allocation Account if desired by selecting that account from the dropdown menu.
* Click the **Save Fee** button to upload your changes to the database.


 


## Scheduling Seasonal Fees


In order for a Seasonal Fee to trigger, it must be assigned to on or more sessions.    


**To schedule a seasonal fee:**


1. 1. Go to the [Scheduling menu](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Scheduling/scheduleseasonalfees.aspx) and then [Finances](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Scheduling/scheduleseasonalfees.aspx)
	2. Click on [Seasonal Fees.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Scheduling/scheduleseasonalfees.aspx)
	3. Select **Season**, by default, the current season will display.
	4. Select **Location.**
	5. Select **Seasonal Fee.**
	6. Click **Load.**
	7. Click the checkbox to the left of any session that could trigger the seasonal fee.
	8. Click the **Save Modifications** button to upload your changes to the database.
# Session Prerequisites
Prerequisites can be used to restrict who can register for a specific session. If someone selects a session with a prerequisite but does not mean its requirements, they will not be able to complete the registration. This advanced setting is managed in the Session Editing wizard.


 


## Creating a Prerequisite


To create a prerequisite, take the following steps:


1. 1. Open the Session Editing wizard for the desired session.
	2. Proceed to the Prerequisites page in the Advanced Settings section of the wizard.
	3. Click the Add a New Prerequisite link.
	4. Follow the prompts to create the prerequisite.


 


## Prerequisite Settings


There are several ways to customize a prerequisite. The following prompts will be shown and determine how the prerequisite behaves: 


* **If this prerequisite is met, should all other prerequisites for this item be disregarded?**
	+ Select **No**if you are planning on using multiple prerequisites for this session and someone must meet them all in order to be eligible. Otherwise, select **Yes**.
* **Indicate if this prerequisite is a Template or Scheduled Item.**
	+ Choose **Scheduled Item** if a specific Session, Option, or Activity will determine eligibility.
	+ Choose **Master** if any item scheduled from a designated template will qualify (this is broader and can reach across seasons).
* **Select if this prerequisite is a Session, Option or Activity.**
	+ Choose Session, Option, or Activity as appropriate.


Depending on your selections, you'll be prompted to choose the specific item or items that determine eligibility (starting with the season if you've chosen a Scheduled Item).


* **Custom Message**
	+ UltraCamp will automatically display an ineligibility message for those who don't qualify. It will identify the missing prerequisite and include a link to register for that item.
	+ Entering a **Custom Message** will replace the default message text.

	4. Click on **Activities.**



  
  


# Tasks and Processes 
Tasks and Processes are a great way to manage items that you or a customer needs to complete. Tasks are like items on a checklist, and the process is like a checklist containing those tasks.





## 


## Tasks


If there are items you or your customers need to complete prior to their arrival, you can accomplish this with tasks. Examples of common tasks would be: Upload Immunization records, Schedule Interview, Upload signed Staff Contract. Upload insurance cards, etc.



#### 
 Note


Keep in mind that online forms already have a built in tracking and completion monitoring, so tasks would not be used for those. Use tasks for everything except online forms.



 


## To create a Task Template:


1. 1. Click on **Settings** and expand **System Management**.
	2. Click on Task Template.
	3. Select Create New Task Template.
	4. Set up your task settings and Save.


**Automated reminder emails**


* Each task can have have up to three automated reminder emails.
* These emails would be sent out on a schedule you determine.
* Only those who have not completed the task would get the reminder email.


 


## Processes


You can create a number of tasks and put them in a process. The process can then be attached to a session, so the associated tasks are automatically assigned when someone registers for that session.


**To create a Process:**


1. 1. Click on Settings and expand System Management.
	2. Choose Processes.
	3. Select Create New Process and name the Process and Save.
	4. Click Add a new task.
	5. Select a task from the drop down menu.
	6. Assign step in process.
	7. Assign due date and **Save**.


**Assigning a process to a session:**


1. 1. Open the session Editing Wizard for the desired session.
	2. Select **My Sessions** and click on the **edit icon** next to the appropriate session.
	3. Expand the **Advanced Settings** tab.
	4. Check the box next to the processes or processes you want attached to the session.
	5. Click **Complete.**


**Adding a process to a stored group:**


1. 1. Create a stored group of individuals using a report such as the roster report.
	2. Then go to the **Tools** menu and click on the **Management Section**.
	3. Click on **Add Process to Stored Group**.
	4. Select the stored group that you created and click the **Next** button.
	5. Select the **Process** and click **Next**.
	6. Confirm the due dates (or leave the dates blank to use the default dates that are already in the process).
	7. Click A**dd Process**.


## 
Completed Tasks


If a task is set up to require a document upload, the public user can complete the task by uploading the appropriate document. The public user must go to the document center and follow the instructions for the associated document.


* To set up a task for a document to be uploaded, a placeholder document must be placed in the document center. Usually this is a PDF that contains the steps for the public user to follow to make sure their document is uploaded correctly.
* The document must have the same name as the document to be uploaded. For example, if an immunization record should be uploaded, the document center document would be named “Immunization Record Upload” (or something similar).
* The document must be set to allow public upload.


## 
Creating a Placeholder Document


**To upload a placeholder document:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings** and select **Communication**.
	2. Click on **Document Management**.
	3. Upload a New Document and fill in Document Name.
	4. Select Category or create a new one.
	5. Upload File: choose file to attach.
		* Keep in mind this is a placeholder document; clients will be clicking the upload button next to the document, not on the document itself.
		* File must be available in the Document Center and enabled.



#### 
 Tip


Create a file with directions for uploading and use that as the placeholder document.



1. 6. Document Processing Type: select Per Person.
	7. Processing Receipt Type to Public: choose receipt type, if any, the public should receive upon upload.
	8. Display Processed Documents to Public: uncheck the box next to if you do not want the public to see the document they upload after it has been processed.
		* Uploaded documents would appear with other online forms on their person/account detail page.
	9. Staff to Notify on Receipt: select who should be notified, if any, when a document is uploaded.
	10. Processed Document Completes Task: select the task that this uploaded document completes.
	11. Form Fill Binding: is not necessary here.
	12. Expiration Type: choose the desired expiration settings for this document.
	13. Allow Public Upload: check box to  "allow public upload".
	14. Save Document.


## Testing a Public Side Document Upload


1. 1. Once set, you can try uploading a document from a test account on the public side.
	2. Once the document is uploaded, go back to the admin home page.
	3. Under My Info, expand Unprocessed Forms. A new uploaded document will appear here.
	4. Click on the most recent item and follow the prompts to process the item.
	5. When this is finished, the document is processed and will therefore complete that task for the individual that uploaded the document.


 

# Task Templates
## How Task Templates Work


* Task Templates are used to track events which are not part of the registration process.
* They can be manually added or automatically added by the completion of a reservation.
* Once added to an account, they can trigger reminder emails, be manually marked complete, or be automatically marked complete by the submission of a document.



#### 
 Note


The due date of a task can trigger a Task Reminder Email. This email can be a custom message or you can use UltraCamp's default Task Reminder Email. Below you will find the text for the default reminder email.



### 


### View Default Task Reminder Email

# Setting Up Custom Transactions
While UltraCamp has the most common types of transactions already built in to the system, your organization may want to add additional transaction types. Custom Transactions allow you to create your own option which will be available to your admins for use on account finances.


The default transaction types are:





 


To add or edit Custom Transactions, take the following steps:


1. Go the Settings menu and expand the **Accounting** section
2. Click [Custom Transaction Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/customTransactionsList.aspx)
3. Click **Create a Custom Transaction Type** or the edit icon to the right of an existing type


 


## Custom Transaction Settings


To create a Custom Transaction, you'll need to enter the appropriate settings.


The **Transaction Name** will display to clients on their financial history and statements as well as in your reporting.


The **Debit / Credit** setting determines how this transaction will impact account finances.


You can set an **Allocation Account Code** for the transaction type, but this will drastically impact financial reporting and should be done with caution. The Allocation number you set here will override the application of your cash number to the items this transaction is paying for. *Only use this if you absolutely need to track your custom transaction separately*.  


By default, all transactions in UltraCamp count towards Cash, except for the built-in Misc Debit and Misc Credit transaction types. You can specify this transaction type as a **Non-cash Transaction** by checking the box.


Checking the **Enabled** box makes this custom transaction an active option for your admins.


* 
# Should I use Activities or Options?
Both Activities and Options offer additional choices and selections as part of registration. Deciding which one to use depends on the features and preferences of what you want to implement.


**Options** are designed to let individuals make selections from a list of one or more items.


**Activities** are designed to let individuals choose their own schedule from a list of selections.


 


## Comparison Chart


The following chart breaks down the differences between the traits for Activities and Options:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trait** | **Activities** | **Options** |
| Easy to Set Up | No | Yes |
| Waiting List | Yes | No |
| Age Limits | Yes | Yes |
| Gender Limits | Yes | No |
| Can use pricing structures | No | Yes |
| Triggers an Online Form | No | Yes |
| Can use date limits | No | Yes |
| Conditional based on a previous selection | No | Yes |
| Template can be reused in the same session | Yes | No |
| Works with Group Reservations | No | Yes |


 


## When should I use Activities?


Use Activities when an individual should make one or more selections that correspond to a part of a day. Here are some examples of when activities work well:


* If an individual must choose a morning class and an afternoon class
* If an individual can sign up for a wait list if an activity is full but still must choose one with openings (in case space doesn't open up)
* If multiple sessions share the same class rosters and capacity limits


 


## When should I use Options?


Options are much more commonly used than activities. Use options when you have pricing that changes based on the number of selections made. Here are some examples of when Options are the best choice:


* For setting up a Day Camp where people can select individual days
* For group registrations where a family selects lodging for their reservation
* For optional add-ons to a reservation like extra care,
# Session Template Overview
Session Templates in UltraCamp function as starting points for all sessions you will schedule from season to season. Our favorite analogy is a stencil. It has an outline and a shape, but no details. Use the template as an outline, then fill in your details in the Session Editing Wizard. Your session comes to life when you schedule it.


**To create a Session Template:**


1. 1. Click on the **Settings Menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates.**
	3. Select **Session** **Templates.**



 


## Key Terms


**Fixed Settings**


* Determined on the template only.
* Designated by a lightning bolt.
* Settings remain true on every item scheduled from this template.


**Flexible Settings**


* Adjusted and customized as needed in each separately scheduled program.
# Setup ACH for Payment Processing
## What is ACH?


ACH (Automated Clearing House) is a banking network that coordinates electronic payments and automated money transfers and is a way to move funds between banks without using paper checks, wire transfers, credit cards, or cash. For UltraCamp, that means it is another method for your clients to submit payment electronically.


## Why should I use ACH?


The biggest reason to use ACH is that it costs your organization less processing fees than credit card payments (approximately 1/3 of the fees incurred by credit card transactions). ACH payments do take longer to clear than credit cards, but they function similarly in every other regard.



#### 
 ACH Fees


Here are the fees you can expect from enabling ACH transactions:


* $5.00 monthly ACH connection fee (only charged in the months that you are taking ACH payments/refunds)
* $0.50/transaction
* 1% of each transaction
* $2.50 returned ACH fee
* $0.25 batch fee



## 


## How to Enable ACH for your Organiation


Setup for ACH is done through the [My Settings Wizard](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/setup/default.aspx). You'll first need to add your organization’s bank account in the Finances section, then enable and complete a two-part ACH Setup in the Client Payments section. Below you will find directions to address each of these parts of setup:


### Adding a Bank Account


To add a banking account, take the following steps:


1. Open the **Settings** menu and expand the **System Management** section
2. Select [My Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/setup/default.aspx) to access the wizard
3. Proceed to the [Account Information](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/billingaccountinfo.aspx) page in the "Finances" section
4. Enter your banking account and routing numbers in the space provided
5. Click the **Next** button (lower right corner) to save





### Enabling ACH Payments


To enable ACH Payments, take the following steps:


1. Open the **Settings** menu and expand the **System Management** section
2. Select [My Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/setup/default.aspx) to access the wizard
3. Proceed to the [ACH?](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/echecks.aspx) page in the "Client Payments" section
4. Select **Yes, I would like use ACH**
5. Click the **Complete** button to move on to the ACH Payment Setup page


### Step 1: ACH Payment Setup


Once you've enabled ACH payments, you need to request an application using the following steps:

2. Scan and upload a voided check using the designated button
3. [Optional] If the average payment by your clients is $1000.00 or more, use the button to upload 3 months of bank statements for your organization
4. Click the **Request Application** button.


This will submit a request to our payment processing team. They will send the Docusign application packet to the person designated in Step 1. When this is submitted, it usually takes about two business days for the application to move through review unless more documentation is requested.


 


### Step 2: ACH Settings


Once the application is approved, and the camp is enabled by payment processing for for ACH, **Step 2** will become available. You will receive an email to let you know when this occurs. You can then return to the My Settings wizard and to finish setup:


1. 1. Open the **Settings** menu and expand the **System Management** section
	2. Select [My Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/setup/default.aspx) to access the wizard
	3. Proceed to the [ACH Payment Setup](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/echecksetup.aspx) page in the "Client Payments" section
	4. Enter your ACH Settings in **Step 2**
		* Select **ACH Contacts** to receive relevant ACH communication from UltraCamp
		* Set your **Returned ACH Fee** for payments that bounce
		* Set your **ACH Error Fee** for payments that are returned for account information errors
		* [Optional] Set a convenience fee and an associated allocation account
		* If you want to encourage ACH use, check the box and enter your own encouragement text if you don't want to use UltraCamp's default
	5. Click the **Complete** button to save your changes


Your organization is now set up for ACH Payment Processing!

# Setting your Registration Page Order
You can control the order of what your clients encounter during the registration process. This is done through the Registration Page Order. There are two ways of setting up a Registration Page Order:


* Use the Session Editing Wizard to make the process unique to each session.
* Use a Page Order Template to make the process consistent across multiple sessions.


It is possible to use a combination of these two approaches, but only if you use separate Session Templates for each approach.


## 


## Page Order Template


A page order template sets up a consistent registration process for one or more Session Templates. It then automatically controls the registration process of all sessions scheduled using this template (or templates).


 


#### Step 1: Create a Page Order Template


**To create a Page Order Template, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Session Templates** section.
	2. Click [Page Order Templates.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageOrderMastersList.aspx)
	3. Click **Create a New Template.**
	4. Enter a **Name** for this template (it will only be visible to admins).
	5. Arrange the page blocks by clicking and dragging the Registration Process section on the right.
	6. Click the **Save** button at the bottom.


You now need to attach this Page Order Template to a Session Template in order for it to have any effect. You can return and edit your Page Order Template at any time by clicking on the template or the icon to the right of it.


 


#### Step 2: Connect a Page Order Template to a Session Template


**To connect your Page Order Template to a Session Template, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Session Templates** section.
	2. Click [Session Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/sessiontemplates.aspx).
	3. Click the edit icon (or create a new Session Template).
	4. In the wizard proceed to the **Registration Information** page.
	5. In the dropdown menu for **Page Order Master**, choose the appropriate template.
	6. Click the **Complete** button to save your changes.


You can now exit the wizard. All sessions that are created using this session template will use the page order you have connected to it. A single Page Order Template can be connected to multiple session templates by repeating Step 2 for each desired Session Template.


## 


## Session Editing Wizard - Registration Page Order


Use the Registration Page Order page in the Session Editing wizard when the session does *not* have a Page Order Template connected. This will give you the most flexibility in setting your page order per session, but it is more work if you don't use UltraCamp's default order.


**To set your Registration Page Order on a session, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Open the **Session Editing** wizard for the session you wish to adjust.
		* From the [**Summary of Sessions**](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/scheduling/sessions.aspx) page, click the edit icon to the right of the desired session.
		* Click the My Sessions menu and then click the edit icon to the right of the desired session.
	2. In the wizard, proceed to the **Registration Page Order** page in the **Basic Settings** section.
	3. Arrange the page blocks by clicking and dragging the Registration Process section on the right.
	4. Click the **Complete** button at the bottom.


This will save your page order for *this session only* and will not impact other sessions.


 



#### 
 Tip


You can use the **Copy Session Settings** tool to copy the Registration Page Order to other sessions that don't have a Page Order Template attached.


 



## 


## Arranging the Page Order


Whether you are using a Page Order Template or the Session Editing Wizard, you will need to arrange the page blocks to adjust the order from UltraCamp's default.


The Page Order tool is divided into three sections:


* **Excluded Pages** - This is for UltraCamp standard pages that you don't want to appear during registration.
* **Custom Online Forms** - These are the online forms you've created to collect custom information from your clients.
* **Registration Process** - This represents your client experience during registration. The blocks at the top will be the first items clients encounter after choosing a reservation. Items at the bottom will be later in registration prior to checkout (which is standardized).


You can adjust these items by clicking on a block and dragging it to the desired place.


 





 


 

# Setting Up a Template - Basic Settings
In the Session Template Wizard, start with the Basic Settings page. This contains the minimum data required to create a template. Once this page is completed, a template will be saved.


 


## To set up in the Session Template Wizard:


1. 1. Go to **Settings menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates section.**
	3. Click on **Session Templates.**
	4. Create a **New Session Template** or edit an existing template using the **edit icon** to the right of the desired template.



#### 
 Note


If you previously clicked "Do not display this page to me again", you will not see that page.



 



 


## Session Name


* Every session template must have a name.
* The Session Name is a flexible setting.
* It functions as a default when scheduling a session which can be adjusted during the Scheduling Process.


 


## Registration Type


* This determines whether a single reservation accommodates one individual or multiple attendees.



#### 
 Note


Registration type is a fixed setting and may not be changed once sessions are scheduled from this template.



* **Individual-based templates** are the most common. Under this scenario a separate reservation is made for each attendee. Individual-based sessions offer the most flexibility in collecting information for and about an individual.
* **Group-based** are for sessions that enroll multiple people within a single reservation. Common examples would be a "Family Camp" or a "Mother / Daughter Weekend."


 


## Session Category


* Session Categories are used to group scheduled events under a particular heading. This can be very helpful to your clients, making your sessions visually organized and easy to view.
	+ This is a fixed setting
	+ All events scheduled from this Session Template will share the same category.
	+ This is an optional field.


* To create a Session Category:
	+ Click on **Settings menu**
	+ Go to **Session Templates**
	+ Select **Session Categories**.


* **Sessions are grouped in the following order:**


1. 1. 1. Location
		2. Session Category
		3. Session Subcategory 1
		4. Session Subcategory 2


 



#### 
 Tip


Only Session Category is set in the Session Template. All others are determined during the Scheduling process.



 


## Session Description


* Session Description text can be entered on the Template.
* Descriptions will show to the public if they indicate they want to learn more detailed information about the session/event you are offering and on the Session Information page.
* Session Name, Dates, Age/Grade restrictions, and Cost are automatically displayed.
* Additional information such as discounts, activities, and options may also be displayed on the Session Information page.



#### 
 Tip


Your clients may access this page if they click on the **Session Name**in the **Summary of Sessions** or the **Info link**on the **Select Sessions page**.



## 


## Photo


* A Photo can be attached to the Session Template. This photo will display on the Session Information page or when clients click the Info while registering.
* This is an optional setting but it is also a fixed setting so the same photo will be used for all sessions scheduled from this Template.
* Use the **Complete button** to save your changes and proceed to the next page.
